## Observation
- Number of coupons of "coffee house" distributed is the largest, which is 3996.
- Number of coupons of "less expensive restaurants (under \\$20)" distributed is the smallest, which is 1492, less than half of those of "coffee house".
- Number of coupons distributed to drivers who age between 21 to 25 is the largest, which is 2653.
- Number of coupons distributed to drivers who age under 21 is the smallest, which is 547.
- Most accepted coupons are with expiration of 1 day, whereas the number of accepted and rejected coupons with expiration of 2 hours are more or less the same.
- Number of conpons of "less expensive restaurant" are accepted when distributed ay 6 PM.
- Most of the coupons are accepted by drivers with Bachelor's degree and age 26, and with drivers with some college education and age  under 21.

## Next steps and recommendations

- For the 'age' collection, specific age is recommended to be included instead of a range for a better analysis.
- Same number of different kinds of coupons should be distributed in order to obtain a fairer analysis.
- Same number of different kinds of coupons should be distributed in different time periods.
- Coupons with expiration of 1 day should be distributed in order to optimize the coupon acceptance.
- Coupons should be distributed to younger drivers to maximize the acceptance of coupons.
- Less expensive coupons should be distributed to drivers at 6 PM to maximize the acceptance of less expensive coupons.
- In general, coffee house coupons and less expensive coupons should be sidtributed in a larger number than the other kind of coupons based on this analysis.
